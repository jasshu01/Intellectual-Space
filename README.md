While working or surfing, we come across various ideas/sources that we want to save for later, but we find it difficult to write them down on paper, and opening a new window and storing our ideas can be a time-consuming task. With this, you can store your ideas in your storage only when you get them.   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/intellectual-space/feogbjfjobbdkkcfmdfoplaaajfoglkl?utm_source=googleads&amp;utm_medium=adgroup5&amp;utm_campaign=adgroup5&amp;utm_id=adgroup5&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAsNKQBhAPEiwAB-I5zYDQK4vS62Aqjw36bq25ev4w2Co5-tp20Y-ixld-GCDy1l_NH-ofHRoC5bEQAvD_BwE
